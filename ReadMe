Real-Time Barcode & QR Code Quality is a browser-based inspection tool.
It leverages your webcam to scan, analyze, and log barcodes and QR codes, providing instant feedback on code quality (sharpness/blurriness), product information, 
and maintains a history of all scans. The application offers export options and does not require any server-side components.
