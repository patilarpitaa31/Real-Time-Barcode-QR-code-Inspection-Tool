Real-Time Barcode & QR Code Quality is a browser-based inspection tool.
It leverages your webcam to scan, analyze, and log barcodes and QR codes, providing instant feedback on code quality (sharpness/blurriness), product information, 
and maintains a history of all scans. The application offers export options and does not require any server-side components.

## Features

- **Real-time Scanning:** Instantly detects barcodes and QR codes from your webcam feed, no button click needed.
- **Quality Analysis:** Automatically inspects each detected code for blurriness using Laplacian variance and highlights issues visually.
- **Multi-code Support:** Detects multiple QR codes and common barcode formats (Code 128, EAN, UPC) simultaneously.
- **Product Lookup:** Fetches product information from a mock database or (optionally) via Google Custom Search API.
- **Scan History:** Keeps a local log of scans, showing code type, value, timestamp, quality status, and location.
- **Export Options:** Export your scan log as JSON, CSV, or Excel with a single click.
- **Overlay Visualization:** Color-coded overlays (green for OK, red for blurry) on the video feed for instant feedback.
- **No Server Required:** All processing is done in your browser; scan history is stored locally.
- **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive interface with support for clearing history and live product detail popups.
